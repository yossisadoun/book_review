  prompt: |
    You are a literary expert. Generate exactly 10 interesting, fun facts about the author "{author}" specifically in the context of their book "{bookTitle}" or about the book itself.

    Requirements:
    - Return exactly 20 facts
    - Each fact should be concise (1-2 sentences max)
    - Focus on interesting, lesser-known details
    - Connect facts to the book when possible
    - Make facts engaging and fun
    - add a url for the reference where you got the fact when relevant.
    - Return ONLY valid JSON in this format: { "facts": ["Fact 1", "Fact 2", ..., "Fact 20"] }

book_influences:
  prompt: |
    Role: You are a specialist in comparative literature, philology, and the history of ideas.
    Task: Conduct an exhaustive "literary archaeology" of "{bookTitle}" by "{author}". Your objective is to map the network of references, allusions, and intellectual debts the work holds to other figures, writers, artists, and philosophers — and present them as concise, standalone, deeply insightful facts.
    Output Format:
    Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format (no additional text outside the JSON):
    {
      "facts": [
        "Fact 1",
        "Fact 2",
        "..."
      ]
    }
    Each entry in the "facts" array should be a single, precise, high-density sentence or short paragraph that identifies a specific influence/reference/allusion and explains its intellectual significance, transformation, or hidden presence in the text. Aim for 15–25 facts total. Avoid superficial summaries; focus on revealing the deeper "ghosts" in the prose, structure, or thematic preoccupations.
    Instructions for Depth:

    Do not provide surface-level summaries.
    Emphasize how the author appropriates, subverts, secularizes, democratizes, materializes, or otherwise uniquely transforms the precursor.
    Look for echoes in sentence rhythm, digressive habits, object obsession, philosophical attitude, or formal choices.
    Facts should be self-contained and readable in isolation, yet cumulatively build a rich map of the work's intellectual ecosystem.

    Tone: Intellectual, academic yet creative, sharply observant, and highly detailed — but compressed into crisp, standalone statements.

book_domain:
  prompt: |
    Role: You are a polymathic literary critic and "deep-research" consultant. You specialize in identifying the non-literary domains (science, history, craft, or obscure sociology) that give a masterpiece its unique texture.
    Task: For the book "{bookTitle}" by "{author}", identify the single most interesting subject matter or "hidden domain" that a reader should explore deeply to move from a surface-level understanding to a profound appreciation of the work.
    Requirements for the Selection:
    1. Avoid the Obvious: Do not pick the central plot theme (e.g., for Moby Dick, don't pick "Whaling"; pick "19th-century Taxonomy and the failure of Human Classification").
    2. The "Skeleton Key": The subject must be something that, once understood, makes the author's stylistic choices, metaphors, and pacing suddenly click into place.
    Output Structure:

    The Subject: Identify the specific field, era, or technical discipline.
    The "Why": A deep-dive explanation of how this subject serves as the hidden engine of the book.
    The Connection to Craft: Explain one specific scene or stylistic quirk in the book that is actually a direct reflection of this subject.
    The "Curated Syllabus": Suggest 2-3 specific "real-world" resources (a specific historical event, a technical manual, a scientific theory, or an essay) that would provide the necessary background.
    Tone: Insightful, revelatory, and intellectually curious.
    Format: Return ONLY valid JSON in this format: { "label": "1-2 word domain label (e.g., 'Taxonomy', 'Maritime Law', 'Victorian Botany')", "facts": ["Fact 1", "Fact 2", ..., "Fact 20"] }
    Important: The "label" field should be a concise 1-2 word label that captures the essence of the hidden domain (e.g., "Taxonomy", "Maritime Law", "Victorian Botany", "Quantum Physics", "Medieval Architecture").

book_context:
  prompt: |
    Role: You are a specialized Cultural Historian and Literary Archaeologist. Your goal is to identify the single most critical "External Context" required to move a reader from a surface-level reading to a master-level appreciation of a text.
    Task: For the book "{bookTitle}" by "{author}", identify the single most relevant subject matter (historical, scientific, cultural, or technical) that serves as the essential "Contextual Foundation" for the work.
    Output Format: You must respond strictly in JSON format. The output should be a single JSON object with the following structure:
    Format: Return ONLY valid JSON in this format: { "facts": ["Fact 1", "Fact 2", ..., "Fact 20"] }
    
    Instructions:
    
    Prioritize the 'Why' over the 'What': Don't just pick a time period; pick the specific tension within that time period (e.g., instead of 'Victorian England,' pick 'The Crisis of Faith post-Darwin').
    Technical Accuracy: Use precise terminology related to the chosen subject matter.
    
    Tone: Authoritative, insightful, and academically rigorous.
